# Track 04 — Software Architecture

Design systems that are maintainable, testable, and scalable. Covers principles, patterns, and architectural styles.

**Estimated time:** 3–4 weeks

## Topics

1. [SOLID Principles](solid-principles.md) — SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP with TypeScript examples
2. [Clean Architecture](clean-architecture.md) — layers, dependency rule, ports and adapters
3. [Hexagonal Architecture](hexagonal-architecture.md) — ports, adapters, primary vs secondary
4. [Domain-Driven Design](domain-driven-design.md) — ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates
5. [Design Patterns: Creational](design-patterns-creational.md) — Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
6. [Design Patterns: Structural](design-patterns-structural.md) — Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy
7. [Design Patterns: Behavioral](design-patterns-behavioral.md) — Strategy, Observer, Command, State
8. [Microservices vs Monolith](microservices-vs-monolith.md) — trade-offs, strangler fig, service boundaries
9. [API Versioning & Contracts](api-versioning-contracts.md) — breaking changes, OpenAPI, contract testing

## Suggested Order

**1 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 8 → 9**

> SOLID first — everything else builds on those principles.
