# Track 01 — Foundations

Everything every developer must know before specializing. Covers how the web works, the core languages, the terminal, and version control.

**Estimated time:** 2–3 weeks

## Topics

1. [How the Web Works](how-the-web-works.md) — DNS, TCP/IP, TLS, HTTP, browser rendering
2. [HTML & CSS](html-css.md) — semantic HTML, box model, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design
3. [JavaScript](javascript.md) — event loop, closures, prototypes, async/await, ES6+
4. [TypeScript](typescript.md) — type system, generics, utility types, narrowing
5. [Linux & Shell](linux-shell.md) — filesystem, commands, permissions, scripting, SSH
6. [Git](git.md) — DAG model, branching, rebase, hooks, conflict resolution

## Suggested Order

**1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6**

> If you already know JS, start at TypeScript. If you're a backend dev, don't skip HTML/CSS — you need to understand the browser.
